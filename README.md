C++ Checkers Game

* Currently in development, not playable yet.
* This is a new programming project that intends to simulate a game of checkers agaisnt an AI opponent.
* Menu and "Save Game" functionality are the two currently operating components right now.
* You can compile with "make" and then execute with standard execution file (preferrably a.out in Linux)
* Once you've selected the "Save Game" option in the main menu, check "save.txt" to see the default checkerboard.
