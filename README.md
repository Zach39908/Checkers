C++ Checkers Game

* Currently in development, not playable yet
* This is a new programming project that intends to simulate a game of checkers agaisnt an AI opponent.
* At the moment, I have initaliazed the checkerboard and created a few functions that can change the boxes on the board.
* If you wish to see the board and operate it's few functions, compile board.cpp and run it through your standard OS executable file.
